# Day 18 Task: Docker for DevOps Engineers

Let's move forward and dig more on other Docker concepts.

1. **Docker Compose**
2. **What is YAML**

## Task-1

Learn how to use the docker-compose.yml file, to set up the environment, configure the services and links between different containers, and also to use environment variables in the docker-compose.yml file.

[Sample docker-compose.yaml file](https://github.com/LondheShubham153/90DaysOfDevOps/blob/master/2023/day18/docker-compose.yaml)

## Task-2

- Pull a pre-existing Docker image from a public repository (e.g. Docker Hub) and run it on your local machine. Run the container as a non-root user (Hint- Use `usermod ` command to give user permission to docker). Make sure you reboot instance after giving permission to user.
- Inspect the container's running processes and exposed ports using the docker inspect command.
- Use the docker logs command to view the container's log output.
- Use the docker stop and docker start commands to stop and start the container.
- Use the docker rm command to remove the container when you're done.
