## What is DevOps ♾️

![DevOps](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/0*NXlBkHolIQvfO_Rr)

There are different ways in which we can define what DevOps really is.

**DevOps** is a practice or a culture you’re adopting in your organisation which will increase your organisations ability to deliver application and services at high velocity.

**DevOps**, short for Development and Operations, is a software development approach/methodology  that focuses on collaboration, communication, and automation between the development (Dev) and operations (Ops) teams. The goal of DevOps is to streamline the software development process, increase efficiency, and deliver high-quality software at a faster pace.

In simplest terms, think of DevOps as a bridge between the people who develop software and the people who manage and maintain the software systems. It brings them together to work closely throughout the entire software development lifecycle.

**DevOps** is a process of improving the application delivery through Continuous Integration/ Continuous Delivery and by ensuring automation, quality, continuous monitoring and continuous testing.


## What is Automation, Scaling and Infrastructure 🤖🚀🛠️👩‍💻

### Automation 🤖
Automation involves using tools, scripts, and processes to automate manual tasks and operations. In DevOps, automation is crucial for achieving speed, consistency, and reliability in software development, deployment, and operations. 

It helps reduce human error, increases efficiency, and enables teams to focus on higher-value activities. Automation can include tasks such as configuration management, provisioning infrastructure, deployment pipelines, testing, monitoring, and incident response.

### Scaling 🚀
Scaling refers to the ability to handle increasing workloads and user demands by adjusting the system's capacity. In cloud computing, scaling can be achieved by scaling vertically (increasing the resources of an individual instance) or scaling horizontally (adding more instances). 

Scaling ensures that the system can handle peak loads without performance degradation or downtime. It is often achieved through load balancers, auto-scaling groups, and dynamic resource allocation.

### Infrastructure 🛠️
Infrastructure in the context of DevOps and cloud computing refers to the underlying technology components required to support software applications. This includes servers, storage, networks, databases, and other resources necessary for running applications. 

Infrastructure can be provisioned and managed using infrastructure-as-code (IaC) tools, which allow for the automated provisioning, configuration, and management of infrastructure resources. Infrastructure as Code enables organizations to version, replicate, and automate the deployment of infrastructure, promoting consistency, reproducibility, and scalability.




## Why DevOps is Important 💯

Before the introduction of DevOps in any organisation the process of planning to build any application till it’s delivery involved various phases (SDLC) and there were different user groups that worked in each phase these groups worked in isolation and had little to no communication among each other. We had developers, system admin, build and release engineer, server admin etc. working on delivering an application, this traditional approach towards development created multiple problems and took more amount of delivery time, to resolve the issues with traditional approach towards development DevOps was introduced.

Below are some points that highlight the importance of DevOps

- Increased Collaboration
- Continuous Integration and Delivery
- Improved Stability and Reliability
- Fater Time to market
- Efficient Resource Utilization
- Continuous Learning and Improvement

> Note: Since DevOps is an approach to improving work in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) process, it is important to understand the concept of SDLC.
